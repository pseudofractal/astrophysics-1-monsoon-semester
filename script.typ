==  Slide 1 (One graph to change them all)

*Show Perlmutter Graph*\
If gravity is attractive, why is the universe expanding at an accelerating rate?
This one plot forced cosmologists to rethink their models of the universe and even reconsider the foundations of GR itself.

== Slide 2 (The Mother of All Cosmology)
Like most things, cosmology we will start with Einstein's field equations:
$
G_(mu nu) = (8 pi G)/(c^4) T_(mu nu)
$
To people who havent done the GR course, this equation may look a bit intimidating.\
But the one thing that this describes above all, is that the space-time curvature responds to matter and radiation.\
In a homogenous and isotopic universe, one can show that there is no truly static configuration.\

== Slide 3 (Einstein' Static Universe)

To fit the observations and biases prevalent at the time, Einstein added a term to the equations called the cosmological constant, which we denote by the Greek letter $Lambda$.

This acts like a unform energy density that fills space homogeneously, which influences curvature and acts efficetively like a repulsive graviy.\
The modified equations allowed a perfectly static universe if Λ exactly balanced gravity.

While it was a philosophically satisfying solution, it was unstable, and any small perturbation would lead to either expansion or contraction.

== Slide 4 (Non Static Universe)

Due to this physical instability, many physicist like Friedmann and Lemaitre decide to ditch the idea of static cosmological solutions.\
In fact Lemaitre derived and predicted a linear relation between velocity and distance, which we now call Hubble's law, two years before Hubble published his observations.\
Lemaitre said confidently that the universe is expanding, and after popularization by Hubble, Einstein dropped the cosmological constant, calling it his "biggest blunder".

== Slide 6 (The Dormant $Lambda$)
For much of 20th century, $Lambda$ was considered unnecessary.\
Friedmann used the metric ansatz for a homogeneous and isotropic universe filled with a fluid, which is now called the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric.\
He put this in the Einstein Field Equations and voila, got the Friedmann equations, which were a great fit for the data.\
And so, $Lambda$ remained dormant for a long time. There were some complications though, QFT decided to complicate things by saying even empty space should have some vaccum energy.\
This was easily the most contracting prediction in physics, so cosmologists mostly ignored it. $Lambda$ stayed 0 for a long time, not by reason but assumption.

== Slide 7 (The Supernova Shock)
In late 1990s, two teams:
- Pearlmutter et al. (Supernova Cosmology Project)
- Riess et al. (High-Z Supernova Search Team)
independently found that SNe Ia were about 0.2 magitudes dimmer than expected.\

Since SNe 1a are standardizable candles, we can infer their peak luminosity by taking a look at their light-curve width.\
There one we calculate the distance modulus $ mu = m - M = 5 log_10 (D_L/(10 "pc")) $
This luminosity distance can be modeled by numeircally solving the integral:
$
D_L = (1+z) c/H_0 integral_0^z (d z prime)/E(z)
$
where $E(z)$ depends on the model of universe:
$
E(z) = sqrt(Omega_m (1+z)^3 + Omega_r (1 + z)^4 + Omega_Lambda + Omega_k (1 + z)^2 )
$

Well, so several people tried to model things again, and argued that a non zero $Lambda$ could reconcile several cosmological tensions. \
Within a year, $Lambda$ was the favourite child of cosmologists again, after half a century.\

== Slide 8 (Current Work)
While the avenues of research in cosmology have increased by a lot, the mystery of dark energy still gets talked about a lot.\
These days, the concept has evolved from a perfect fluid with constant energy density to a whole zoo of models with dynamic equations of state.\
There are also theories that modify GR itself, like f(R) gravity, to explain the accelerated expansion without invoking dark energy.\
A field that was dormant for a long time has become one of the most active areas of research in cosmology today, because of one graph that showed us the truth.
