= Dark Energy

This repository contains the source code for the term paper  
and presentation on Dark Energy that I will give for fulfilling  
the requirements of the course  
"[PHY637 - Astrophysics I: Astrophysical Processes and Stars](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/files/webfolders/courses-of-study-2023_Updated/node326.html)"  
taken by [Prof. Biman Nath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biman_B._Nath)  
in the Monsoon Semester of 2025 at IISER Mohali.

The term paper is written and compiled using [Typst](https://typst.app/)  
which is a modern typesetting system.\
The presentation too is made using [Polylux](https://polylux.dev/book)  
which is a presentation making library built on top of Typst.

The bibliography is in [Hayagriva](https://github.com/typst/hayagriva/blob/main/docs/file-format.md)  
which is a modern biobliography file format built on top of YAML.
